# Distract and Destroy

:::note CHALLENGE DESCRIPTION

After defeating her first monster, Alex stood frozen, staring up at another massive, hulking creature that loomed over her. She knew that this was a fight she couldn't win on her own. She turned to her guildmates, trying to come up with a plan. "We need to distract it," Alex said. "If we can get it off balance, we might be able to take it down." Her guildmates nodded, their eyes narrowed in determination. They quickly came up with a plan to lure the monster away from their position, using a combination of noise and movement to distract it. As they put their plan into action, Alex drew her sword and waited for her chance.

打败第一只怪物后，艾丽克丝呆呆地站在原地，仰望着另一个庞大的怪物。她知道，单凭自己的力量是无法赢得这场战斗的。她转向她的同伴，试图想出一个计划。“我们需要分散它的注意力，"亚历克斯说。“如果我们能让它失去平衡，也许就能拿下它。” 她的公会伙伴们点点头，眼睛眯成一条缝，下定决心。他们很快就想出了一个引诱怪物离开他们位置的计划，利用声音和动作的组合来分散它的注意力。当他们将计划付诸行动时，亚历克斯拔出了剑，等待着机会。
